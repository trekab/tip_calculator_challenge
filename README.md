# **Tip Calculator Challenge**

Welcome to the **Tip Calculator Challenge**! This task is designed to test your problem-solving skills, ability to learn new technologies, and attention to detail. You'll build a Ruby on Rails application that implements the functionality of the [Frontend Mentor Tip Calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) with an additional feature: an **Admin Dashboard** to track past calculations.
